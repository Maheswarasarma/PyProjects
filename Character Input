# Ex: 1
# Program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year that they will turn 100 years old.
# 
# 

# # Extras:
# 
# Add on to the previous program by asking the user for another number and printing out that many copies of the previous message. (Hint: order of operations exists in Python)
# Print out that many copies of the previous message on separate lines. (Hint: the string "\n is the same as pressing the ENTER button)
# 

#importing datetime module
from datetime import datetime as date

#asking the user name
name = input('Type your name:')

#asking age and converting to int if needed
age = int(input('Type your age:'))

#get the current year
now = date.now()

#get difference between age for 100 years
diff = 100 - age

#show exactly year that user will turn 100 years old
print 'Hi'+' '+name+" you will complete 100 years in ",(now.year+diff))
